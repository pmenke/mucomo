# mucomo - Multimodal Corpus Model

**mucomo** is a lightweight library for the representation and management of multimodal corpora. It is a reference implementation of the data model which forms the central element of my ongoing dissertation project. This enterprise is associated with the project X1 "Multimodal Alignment Corpora" at the Collaborative Research Centre 673 "Alignment in Communication", funded by the German Research (DFG / Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).


## First steps


## Naming conventions

- **Identifiers** exist for internal purposes only, e.g. for the organization of ID/REF pairs in XML. 
- **Names** are short and unique, but human-readable, keys or codes for a corpus or another object.
- **Titles** are longer and more detailed names, often used in an official context.

## Contributing to mucomo
 
- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
